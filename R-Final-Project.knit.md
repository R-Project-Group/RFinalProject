# What are the drivers of police killings in the US?

## Executive Summary

## Goal of the study
Police killings have been on the forefront of the news in the recent years and is a prominent issue the United States is facing today. Our objective in this study is to identify insights within this dataset that may illuminate drivers of killings and identify possible biases in how police use lethality in their techniques.

## Data sources
The primary data-set our study is based on is a police killings database maintained by the Washington Post. The data is comprehensive starting from January 1st, 2015 through early May 2021, compiled from local news reports, law enforcement websites, and mining independent databases dedicated to tracking police killings. See the source article here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/ and the available data here: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings

To supplement this data, we utilized the Census Bureau data tool to download demographic and economic information available at the county level and joined it with the killings data by county (or FIPS code). The Census Bureau has a data query tool that appears fairly comprehensive but is also a bit un-intuitive to use. Nonetheless, we pulled in five different county-level data-sets from the American Community Survey which was last taken in 2019. These reports include 1) Demographics and Housing, Educational Attainment, Financial Characteristics, Selected Economics Characteristics, Selected Housing Characteristics.

# Read-in data

# These are census shape files which we need to map latitude and longitutde to FIPs codes
census_tracts <- st_read("CensusShapes2/cb_2018_us_county_within_cd116_500k.shp", quiet = TRUE)

# This is the police killing data from Kaggle
killdata <- read.csv("PoliceKillingsUS_MC.csv")

# This is a look-up table that maps FIPS code to County name and State (from: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697)
fipsLookUp <- read.csv("FIPSCountyStateLookUp.csv", colClasses ='character') 
fipsLookUp$fips <- fipsLookUp[,1] # Import has made the FIPS column name weird so re-making column

# First-off, we need take our geo-coordinates of each police killing and map it to a county (uniquely identified by a FIPS code). This is because all the census data we plan to join in is readily available at the county level

# There are APIs that do this, but we couldn't figure out how to get them to work. Instead, we found a tutorial that relies on plotting lat/long within county boundaries as defined in the shape files. Tutorial here: https://shiandy.com/post/2020/11/02/mapping-lat-long-to-fips/

# Remove the lat/long from the killing data to feed into this algorithm

```
## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar
## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar

There does not seem to be any discernable pattern in killings from year to year.

The 10 highest county annual killing rates over the six year period of 2015-2020 are: Tehama, CA, Pueblo, CO, Fairbanks North Star, AK, Shasta, CA, Muskogee, OK, St. Louis, MO, Lea, NM, Coconino, AZ, Apache, AZ, Yellowstone, MT. It's hard to discern commonalities among these ten counties, but one clear trend is that they are almost all in the Western part of the United States. None of them are in major cities, either. 


```r
#joins the data frame with FIPs and killing rate with the county map
county_map <- left_join(counties_sf, fulldata, by = "county_fips", copy = TRUE)

#filters to make all FIPS with zero killing 0
county_map_filtered <- 
  county_map %>%
  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))

#plots the map
county_map_filtered %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = killingRate),
          color = NA, size = 0.05) +
  labs(fill = "Annual Rate of Police Killings") + 
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
```

It looks like generally, the more populous areas of the country have higher rates of killing (lots of Midwestern counties with zero killings). The southwest in particular seems to be an area with especially higher rates of killing.
